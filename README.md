# COVID-19 Tweet Sentiment Analysis

This project analyzes the sentiment of tweets related to COVID-19 using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. The goal was to clean and preprocess raw tweets, extract meaningful features, and evaluate different models for sentiment classification.

## üìä Dataset
- Source: [Corona NLP Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datatattle/covid-19-nlp-text-classification)  
- Columns: `UserName, ScreenName, Location, TweetAt, OriginalTweet, Sentiment`  
- Sentiment classes were consolidated into **3 categories**:
  - **0** ‚Üí Negative (Extremely Negative, Negative)  
  - **1** ‚Üí Neutral  
  - **2** ‚Üí Positive (Positive, Extremely Positive)

## üîé Key Steps

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Checked label distribution in training and test sets
   - Visualized class imbalance

2. **Preprocessing**
   - Removed unnecessary columns (e.g., `Location`)
   - Cleaned text (lowercasing, removing links, punctuation, and numbers)
   - Created a `Processed_Text` column for modeling
   - Mapped multi-class sentiment labels into 3 categories (Negative, Neutral, Positive)

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Applied **TF-IDF Vectorization** (max 5,000 features, stopwords removed)
   - Visualized top contributing words for sample tweets

4. **Modeling**
   - **Na√Øve Bayes (MultinomialNB)**
   - **Random Forest Classifier**
   - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
   - Evaluated using precision, recall, and F1-score

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack
- **Python**: pandas, numpy, re, matplotlib, seaborn  
- **NLP & ML**: scikit-learn (TF-IDF, Na√Øve Bayes, Random Forest, SVM)  

---

## üìà Results
- **Na√Øve Bayes**: Performed well on imbalanced classes, fast and efficient.  
- **Random Forest**: Balanced accuracy across classes, interpretable feature importance.  
- **SVM**: Achieved strong overall accuracy with linear kernel.
